= Example

== The scenario revisited

Our plugin should be able to connect to a http server, issue a GET or HEAD
request on the base url (e.g. http://localhost/) and return the http return code
as trait and the time it took as numeric data (see below).

image::scenario_overview.png[Scenario Overview]

To make things easier for the purpose of this first implementation, we will have
the agent running on the machine the RHQ server lives on and we will just try to
get data from the Servers' http connector at port 7080 (the default port).

== What do we need ?

In order to write our plugin we basically need three things:

* A plugin descriptor. This contains metadata about the plugin: which metrics
should be collected, what operations does it support etc.
* A discovery component. This part discovers the actual resource(s) and delivers
them to the Inventory.
* A plugin component. This component executes operations and gathers the
measurement data etc.

So lets have a look into those three parts.

[[ref-pd-main]]
=== Plugin descriptor

The plugin descriptor is described by an XML Schema that you can find in the
subversion repository. The basic structure is as follows:

image::plugin_descriptor_structure.png[Structure of the plugin descriptor]

The descriptor consists of a few sections. First you can express dependencies to
other plugins. This is allows reuse of existing plugins and is useful when you
e.g. want to write a plugin that itself needs the JMX plugin, so that it can do
its work (see also "Decomposing Plugins" below).

The next are a row of platform/server/service sections. Each of those can have
the same (XML-)content as the platform that is shown as an example - they are
all of the same (XML-) data type (as a platform/server/service) as each is a
kind of resource type, as you already know from the first part.
Example:

[source,xml]
    <service name="CheckHttp">
        <metric property="responseTime"
             description="How long did it take to connect"
             displayType="Summary"
             displayName="Time to get the response"
             units="ms" />
    </service>

The name of a `<service>` and the other ResourceTypes (platform, server) must
be unique for a plugin. So it is not allowed to have two services named
"CheckHttp" within our example plugin, but you could write a Tomcat5 and a
separate Tomcat6 plugin that both have a service with the name "connector".

For the start we are especially interested in one of the sub elements: `metric`
for our example plugin, so I will describe this here in a little more detail.
For all other tags refer to the XML Schema that has a lot of comments.

==== The "Metric" element

This is a simple element with a bunch of attributes and no child tags. You have
already seen an example above.
Attributes of it are:

* property: name of this metric. Can be obtained in the code via `getName()`
* description: A human readable description of the metric
* displayName: The name that gets displayed
* dataType: Type of metric (numeric / trait /...)
* units: The measurement units for numerical dataType
* displayType: if set to "summary", the metric will show at the indicator
charts and collected by default
* defaultOn: Shall this metric collected by default
* measurementType: what characteristics do the numerical values have (trends up,
trends down, dynamic). The system will for trends* metrics, automatically create
additional per minute metrics, which usually make more sense than the
raw data (take e.g. number of http requsts served. 1.3 million does not really
convey anything, but 6000 per minute does).

For the sample plugin we will use a metric with numerical `dataType` for the
response time and a `dataType` of trait for the Status code. Traits are meant to
be data values that only rarely change like OS version, IP Address of an
ethernet interface or the hostname. RHQ is intelligent enough to only store
changed traits to conserve space.

=== Discovery component

The discovery component will be called by the `InventoryManager` in the agent to
discover resources. This can be done by a process table scan (e.g. for the
Postgres plugin) or by any other means (if your plugin wants to look for
JMX-based resources, then it can just query the MbeanServer. Well, actually
there is a JMX-Plugin that can do that for you in clever ways).

IMPORTANT: The most important thing here is that the Discovery component must **return the
same unique key each time for the same resource**.

The DiscoveryComponent needs to implement
`org.rhq.core.pluginapi.inventory.ResourceDiscoveryComponent` and you need to
implement `discoverResources()`.
The usual code block that you will see in `discoverResources()` is:

[source,java]
    Set<DiscoveredResourceDetails> result =
        new HashSet<DiscoveredResourceDetails>();
      for ( ... ) {
         ...
         DiscoveredResourceDetails detail = new DiscoveredResourceDetails(
           context.getResourceType(),
           uniqueResourceKey,
           resourceName,
           resourceVersion,
           description,
           configuration, // can be null if no configuration
           processInfo);  // can be null for no process scan
         result.add(detail);
      }
      return result;

Basically the context passed in gives you a lot of information, that you can use
to discover the resource and create a `DiscoveredResourceDetails` object per
discovered resource. The list of result objects is then returned to the caller.
Simple - eh?

=== Plugin component

The plugin component is the part of the plugin that does the work after the
discovery has finished.
For each of the "basic functions" in the plugin descriptor, it needs to
implement an appropriate Facet:

* `<metric>`: MeasurementFacet
* `<operation>`: OperationFacet
* `<resource-configuration>`:  ConfigurationFacet


Each Facet has its own methods to implement. In the case of the
`MeasurementFacet` this is e.g. `getValues(MeasurementReport report, Set
metrics)`. The report passed in is where you add your results. The `metrics`
parameter is a list of metrics for which data should be gathered. This can be
all of your defined `<metric>` elements at once or only a few of
them - this depends
on the schedules the user configured in the GUI.
You will find more information about other factes below.
Remember: for the start we just have a very simple version of the plugin. We
will enhance it below.
First let's talk about the project structure in the file system.

== The RHQ project structure

To make things easier, we will host this plugin just within the RHQ tree. So go
and check out RHQ from {git}[its git
repo]. Build the
project as described on the https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/RHQ/Building+RHQ[build page of the wiki]. After that is done, we will
start to add our plugin into `modules/plugins/`.
As an alternative, you can use the skeleton-plugin as described in the wiki -
in this case you do not need to check out RHQ completely.

=== Directory layout

Create the following directory structure:

image::directory_layout.png[Directory structure]

Add `modules/plugins/httptest/src/main/java` to the build path in your IDE.
The classes within `org.rhq.plugins.httptest` form the plugin discovery
component and plugin component and will be described below.

=== Maven pom

RHQ is a mavenized project, thus we need to supply a pom file. Easiest is to
just grab another pom, copy it over to the root of the plugin subtree and change
at least the `artifactId`:

[source,xml]
    <groupId>org.rhq</groupId>
    <artifactId>rhq-httptest-plugin</artifactId>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <name>RHQ HttpTest Plugin</name>
    <description>A plugin to monitor http servers</description>

Please note that this only defines the pom for this subtree - it will not add
this to the global project. To do this, you need to add the httptest plugin to
the parent pom at the `modules/plugins/` level:

[source,xml]
    <modules>
       <module>platform</module>
         ...
       <module>postgres</module>
       <module>httptest</module>
    </modules>

=== The artifacts of our plugin

We will now look at the individual three artifacts that make up a plugin. The
directory tree above shows where they are located.

==== Plugin discovery component

First we start with discovering our server. This is relatively simple and
directly follows the description in the previous part.

[source,java]
----
    public class HttpDiscoveryComponent implements ResourceDiscoveryComponent
    {
      public Set discoverResources(ResourceDiscoveryContext context) throws
           InvalidPluginConfigurationException, Exception
      {
        Set<DiscoveredResourceDetails> result =
          new HashSet<DiscoveredResourceDetails>();

        String key = "http://localhost:7080/"; // RHQ server
        String name = key;
        String description = "Http server at " + key;
        Configuration configuration = null;
        ResourceType resourceType = context.getResourceType();
        DiscoveredResourceDetails detail = new DiscoveredResourceDetails(
               resourceType,
               key,
               name,
               null,
               description,
               configuration,
               null );
        result.add(detail);
        return result;
      }
    }
----

Again it is extremely important that the key is/stays the same for each
discovery performed!

==== Plugin component

So the next part is the plugin component to do the work:

[source,java]
    public class HttpComponent implements ResourceComponent, MeasurementFacet {
      URL url;       // remote server url
      long time;     // response time from last collection
      String status; // Status code from last collection

As we want to monitor stuff, we need to implement the `MeasurementFacet` with
the `getValues()` method (see below).
But first we implement two of the methods from `ResourceComponent`. The first
returns the availability of the remote server. We check if the status is `null`
or 500 and return DOWN, otherwise UP.

[source,java]
      public AvailabilityType getAvailability() {
        if (status == null || status.startsWith("5")) {
          return AvailabilityType.DOWN;
        }
        return AvailabilityType.UP;
      }

One needs to be careful here, as the discovery will not happen as long as this
method is returning DOWN. So we provide a valid start value in the `start()`
method from the `ResourceComponent`:

[source,java]
      public void start(ResourceContext context) throws
         InvalidPluginConfigurationException, Exception
      {
        url = new URL("http://localhost:7080/");
        // Provide an initial status,
        //  so getAvailability() returns UP
        status = "200";
      }

Analogous to `start()` there is a `stop()` method, that can be used to clean up
resources, which we leave empty and don't show it here.

This leads us to `getValues()` from the MeasurementFacet:

[source,java]
      public void getValues(MeasurementReport report,
           Set<MeasurementScheduleRequest> metrics) throws Exception
      {
        getData();
        // Loop over the incoming requests and
        // fill in the requested data
        for (MeasurementScheduleRequest request : metrics) {
          if (request.getName().equals("responseTime")) {
            report.addData(new MeasurementDataNumeric( request, new Double(time)));
          }
          else if (request.getName().equals("status")) {
            report.addData(new MeasurementDataTrait (request, status));
          }
        }
      }

We get data from the remote and then loop over the incoming request to see which
metric is wanted and fill it in. Depending on the type we need to wrap it into
the correct `MeasurementData*` class.
This leaves the implementation of `getData()`:

[source,java]
      private void getData()
      {
        HttpURLConnection con = null;
        int code = 0;
        try {
          con = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
          con.setConnectTimeout(1000);
          long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
          con.connect();
          code = con.getResponseCode();
          long t2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
          time = t2 - now;
        } catch (Exception e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
        if (con != null) {
          con.disconnect();
         }
         status = String.valueOf(code);
      }

Again this is nothing fancy. Just open a URL connection, take the time it takes
to connect, get the status code and we are done. Of course, this could be
optimized, but for this article I wanted to use a simple solution.

==== Plugin descriptor

The plugin descriptor is where everything is glued together. First we start off
with some "boiler plate" code:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <plugin name="HttpTest"
       displayName="HttpTest plugin"
       package="org.rhq.plugins.httptest"
       version="2.0"
       description="Monitoring of http servers"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns="urn:xmlns:rhq-plugin"
       xmlns:c="urn:xmlns:rhq-configuration">

The package attribute predefines the Java package for Java class names that
appear later in the descriptor.

      <server name="HttpServer"
            discovery="HttpDiscoveryComponent"
            class="HttpComponent"
            description="Http Server">

We define our plugin as a Server. From the intuition it could be a Service, but
Services can't just live on their own so we choose a server here. The
attribute class denotes the plugin component and discovery the discovery
component. If you have specified the package above, you can just use the class
name without prefix.

      <metric property="responseTime"
              displayName="Response Time"
              measurementType="dynamic"
              units="milliseconds"
              displayType="summary"/>

      <metric property="status"
              displayName="Status Code"
              dataType="trait"
              displayType="summary"/>
     </server>
    </plugin>

Now the two metrics. With all the knowledge you have now, they are nothing
special anymore.
Again, `responseTime` is modeled as numerical data, while the status is modeled
as trait. This could have been done differently, but is done here for
educational purposes :-)

== Ready, steady, go ...

To compile the plugin, go to the root of the plugin tree and do mvn -Pdev
install
The dev mode allows maven to automatically deploy the plugin to a server
instance as described on the Advanced Built Notes page on the RHQ-Wiki.
When the server is running or starting up, you will see a line like this in the
server log:

    14:23:31,558 INFO  [ProductPluginDeployer] Discovered agent plugin [HttpTest]
    14:23:31,574 INFO  [ProductPluginDeployer] Deploying [1] new or updated agent plugins: [HttpTest]
    14:23:31,665 INFO  [ResourceMetadataManagerBean] Updating resource type [HttpTest:HttpServer(id=0)]...
    14:23:31,667 INFO  [ResourceMetadataManagerBean] Persisting new ResourceType [HttpTest:HttpServer(id=0)]...
    14:23:31,791 INFO  [ProductPluginDeployer] Plugin metadata updates are complete for [1] plugins: [HttpTest]


The next step is to make the plugin available to the agent. Remember that the
agent is usually pulling plugins from the server when it is starting up. So if
you have not yet started the agent, there is nothing to do for you. If the agent
is already started, you can issue `plugins update` at the command prompt to
update them to the latest versions of the server.

    snert$ bin/rhq-agent.sh
    Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 8788
    RHQ 4.5.0-SNAPSHOT [963a082] (Tue Aug 21 09:57:02 EDT 2012)
    > plugins update
    The plugin container has been stopped.
    Updating plugins to their latest versions.
    The plugin [HttpTest] has been updated at [rhq-httptest-plugin-4.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar].
    Completed updating the plugins to their latest versions.
    The plugin container has been started.
    >

If you now log into the GUI at http://localhost:7080/ and go to
menu:Inventory[Discovery Queue] you import the new server into Inventory.

image::discovery_queue.png[Discovery Queue]

Next go to the resource browser, click on 'Servers' and you can see the
server 'discovered' by our plugin:

image::inventory_servers.png[Servers in Inventory]

Clicking on the server name (the link) leads you to the details page for the
resource. Clicking on Monitoring->Graphs brings you to the graphical metric
display, where (after some time) you can see the response time values:

image::metrics_from_plugin.png[Metrics display]

When you click on the Tables subtab, you can see the response time data for the
server in a tabular way,
while the trait for the status code can be found on the Traits subtab.

== What do we have now?

Congratulations, you just wrote your first RHQ plugin, that can also be used in
JBoss ON 2. Writing a plugin consists of three parts: Discovery, Plugin
Component and plugin descriptor. The agent with its plugin container is
providing you with all the infrastructure to talk to the server, scheduling of
metric gathering, scheduling of discovery etc. This means that you can fully
concentrate on the business code of your plugin. RHQ just does the rest.

I have made the source code of those articles available as zip archive, that you
can unpack in the `modules/plugins/` directory.

== Enhancing the plugin

We have just built our first RHQ plugin. This was working great, but hardcoding
the target URL is not really elegant. I will now show you how to make the target
URLs configurable from the GUI.
To do this we need to reshuffle things a little: We will have a generic Server
'HttpCheck' that servers as parent for the individual
http-servers that we want to monitor. Those will live as Services under that
Server. In the Server inventory we will add the possibility to manually add new
http servers on the go.

NOTE: Before you continue, go to menu:Administration[] and then to the Agent plugins
section and remove the old plugin.

image::manual_add.png[RHQ Architecture]

As you may have already guessed, most of this is done in the plugin descriptor.
We also need some small code changes, but those are mostly to separate the
concerns of the various files. Lets start with the changed plugin descriptor.

== Changed plugin descriptor

The boilerplate code is the same as before and will thus not be shown again.

    <server name="HttpCheck"
        description="Httpserver pinging"
        discovery="HttpDiscoveryComponent"
        class="HttpComponent">

I have changed the name of the Server to HttpCheck, as this is nicer in the GUI.
Now the interesting part starts:

      <service name="HttpServer"
           discovery="HttpServiceDiscoveryComponent"
           class="HttpServiceComponent"
           description="One remote Http Server"
           supportsManualAdd="true">

Here we introduce a Service as child of the above Server. It has its own Plugin
Component and Discovery classes (the name of the classes reflect that they
belong to this Service). Technically they could have gone into the existing
classes, but this way it is more obvious who does what. The attribute
_supportsManualAdd_ tells RHQ that those HttpServer Services can be added by the
operator in the GUI - just what we want.

        <plugin-configuration>
           <c:simple-property name="url" type="string" required="true" />
        </plugin-configuration>

The plugin-configuration tells RHQ that this service can be configured with one
simple property, the URL of the remote, which is required. I'll talk a bit
more about properties in a minute.
Last but not least, we have moved the two metrics into the service tag (so I
don't show them in detail again:

        <metric property="responseTime" ...
        <metric property="status" ...
       </service>
    </server>

=== A word about configuration and properties

The configuration type presented here, can be used in several forms within a
plugin descriptor: plugin-configuration
and resource-configuration inside a resource type and then also inside
`operation` elements.
Check the structure diagram in section <<ref-pd-main,plugin descriptor>> above
to see where they belong.
A configuration can consist of a number of sub-elements - notably properties
that are children of the abstract configurationType. This is described below.

image::configuration_structure.png[Structure of configuration elements]

In addition it is possible to group properties together in the group element.
The GUI will show those in their own collapsable section. Allowed child elements
of group are one description element and instances of the abstract
configuration-property. Templates allow you to preset some configuration
properties, so the user has only to fill in stuff that is needed or that they
want to change. The template itself is of the configuration type and thus no
shown again.

==== Properties
Properties allow you to specify individual aspects of a configuration. There are
three types of properties:

* simple-property: for one key value pair, as shown above
* map-property: for a bunch of key value pairs, following the java.util.Map
concept
* list-property: for a list of properties.

image::configuration_property_structure.png[Structure of configuration-property elements]


As you can see from the structural diagram, it is possible to nest configuration
properties within list-property and map-property elements to compose more
complex configurations.
If we would want to allow our Services to add multiple remote servers with
properties of 'host', 'port', 'protocol' it could look like this:

    <plugin-configuration>
      <c:list-property name="Servers">
        <c:map-property name="OneServer">
          <c:simple-property name="host"/>
          <c:simple-property name="port">
            <c:integer-constraint
                minimum="0"
                maximum="65535"/>
            </c:simple-property>
          <c:simple-property name="protocol">
            <c:property-options>
              <c:option value="http" default="true"/>
              <c:option value="https"/>
            </c:property-options>
          </c:simple-property>
        </c:map-property>
      </c:list-property>
    </plugin-configuration>

This example also shows a few more possibilities we have here: The port has a
constraint so, the GUI can validate the input being between 0 and 2^16-1. For
the protocol, we offer the user a drop down list / radio buttons to choose the
protocol from. It defaults to 'http', as indicated on the option element.

=== Change in discovery components

These changes are - as already indicated - more or less just for clarity
reasons and to clearly separate out the concerns of each component.

==== Server level: HttpDiscoveryComponent

The HttpDiscoveryComponent from above only got some minor adjustments to cater
for the change in naming, so I am not showing it here - have a look at the
provided sources archive for details.

==== Service level: HttpServiceDiscoveryComponent

The `HttpServiceDiscoveryComponent` is more interesting, as we no longer have
the hard coded keys, but we get the URL passed in from the GUI when the user is
adding a new one. Here you will also see a new facet (`ManualAddFacet`), that
has been introduced to support `supportsManualAdd="true"` from the plugin
descriptor.
Let's start with the basic implementation of `ResourceDiscoveryComponent`:

    public class HttpServiceDiscoveryComponent implements
       ResourceDiscoveryComponent, ManualAddFacet
    {
       public Set<DiscoveredResourceDetails> discoverResources
            (ResourceDiscoveryContext context) throws
             InvalidPluginConfigurationException, Exception
       {
          return Collections.emptySet();
       }

This just returns an empty set, as we don't want to automatically discovery
these kinds of resources.
The implementation of the `ManualAddFacet`then looks like this:

    @Override
    public DiscoveredResourceDetails discoverResource(Configuration pluginConfiguration,
        ResourceDiscoveryContext context) throws InvalidPluginConfigurationException {

        ResourceType resourceType = context.getResourceType();
        String key = pluginConfiguration.getSimpleValue("url", null);
        if (key == null)
            throw new InvalidPluginConfigurationException("No URL provided");
        String name = key;
        String description = "Http server at " + key;
        DiscoveredResourceDetails detail = new DiscoveredResourceDetails(
            resourceType,
            key,
            name,
            null,
            description,
            pluginConfiguration,
            null);
        return detail;
    }

This methods gets one create request at a time passed in. We check if there is
some url given
at all (in fact the definition in the plugin descriptor prevents empty
properties already, but
it is good to check anyway) and then just creates a new
`DiscoveredResourceDetails` object, which
is then returned.

=== Change in plugin components

The change in plugin components in basically that the old `HttpComponent` got
renamed to `HttpServiceComponent` and that we have a new "pseudo"
`HttpComponent` on server level.

==== Server level - HttpComponent
Ok, this one is - as just described - a dummy implementation, as it just
provides placeholder methods from the ResourceComponent interface.

    public AvailabilityType getAvailability() {
        return AvailabilityType.UP;
      }

We set the Availability to being always UP so the component can successfully
start. We leave the other two methods just as empty implementations.

==== Service level - HttpServiceComponent
As indicated this is more or less the old HttpComponent except for one change:

    public void start(ResourceContext context) throws
      InvalidPluginConfigurationException, Exception
      {
       url = new URL(context.getResourceKey()); // Provide an initial status, so
                                                // getAvailability() returns up
       status = "200";
      }

We are now setting the URL when the component is starting be reading it from the
passed ResourceContext.
Building the enhanced plugin
The updated plugin can be built as shown in the previous part by calling mvn
-Pdev install in the root of plugin source tree.

== Summary
You have just seen, how easy it is to pass plugin configuration parameters from
the GUI to a plugin by expressing the parameters in the plugin descriptor. Our
plugin is now able to have an arbitrary number of child services that each
monitor a different remote http server. The changes needed are basically a few
more lines of XML and a little bit more Java code.
