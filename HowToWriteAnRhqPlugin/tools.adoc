= Tools

== Preface
This section describes tools around the development of agent plugins.
While the process is straightforward, there are still a lot of steps
to consider when writing and testing the plugin.

== Plugin generator

Above you have seen that writing a plugin is not that hard, but that it still
needs a lot of work to
get the basic environment like plugin descriptor skeleton, maven-pom-file and
directory structure in place.
RHQ project has a plugin generator, which asks you some questions and will then
generate a plugin
with some dummy values, which you can then load into your development
environment and continue
working with.

You can download the generator from RHQ's presence on
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rhq/files/rhq/plugin-generator/[SourceForge]
or build it from source in the RHQ source.


=== Sample run

You can just start the plugin generator via `java -jar`. It will then
prompt you with a number of questions, where some have a default like 'n' in
'(y/N)', that you can apply by pressing return.

    $ java -jar target/rhq-pluginGen-4.5.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

First we need to determine the resource category of the root type in the plugin.

    Please specify the plugin root category PLATFORM(P), SERVER(S), SERVICE(I),
s
Next we need to give the name of the base type of the plugin, which is also
taken as the directory name of the plugin, the package for the plugin's classes
as well as the base directory into which our plugin will be written.

    Please specify its Name: jmxdemo
    Please specify its PackagePrefix: org.rhq.plugins
    Please specify its FileSystemRoot: /im/rhq/modules/plugins

Finally you need to provide the class names of the component and discovery
classes of the plugin.

    Please specify its ComponentClass: DemoComponent
    Please specify its DiscoveryClass: DemoDiscovery

From here on, the generator asks for support of the various facets and
will then create respective entries in the plugin descriptor, as well
as in generated code artefacts.

    Please specify if it should support Events (y/N):
    Please specify its ParentType: MBeanResourceComponent
    Please specify if it should support HasMetrics (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support HasOperations (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support Singleton (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support ResourceConfiguration (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support SupportFacet (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support CreateChildren (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support UsesExternalJarsInPlugin (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support DeleteChildren (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support ManualAddOfResourceType (y/N):
    Please specify if it should support UsePluginLifecycleListenerApi (y/N):

If your plugin needs JMX to talk to the managed resource, you can use the
JMX-plugin for RHQ that helps you with connecting to the JMX server etc.

    Please specify if it should support DependsOnJmxPlugin (y/N): y

Finally you need to provide some more information about the plugin
itself like the version of RHQ to build with, the name as it shows up in the UI
and some descriptions.

    Please specify its RhqVersion: 4.5.0-SNAPSHOT
    Please specify its PluginName: rhq-jmxdemo
    Please specify its PluginDescription: Test for local JMX connections
    Please specify its Description: Test JDK6 jmx connections

    Do you want to add a child to jmxdemo? (y/N) n

If you choose to add a child resource type to the above, you need to proide
the Facet and other information about the child type. Otherwise the generator
will continue, print a summary of your input and then generate the
artefacts.

    INFO: Done ..

When it is done, it will also remind you of some next steps.

    Don't forget to
      - add your plugin to the parent pom.xml if needed
      - edit pom.xml of your plugin
      - edit rhq-plugin.xml of your plugin

At this point you will have a plugin fragment that you can then load into your
editor and start coding.


== Standalone plugin container

Above I have described how you can deploy the plugin to the server and then when
it is deployed tell the
agent to fetch it to also have it deployed there. Especially when you start
writing a new plugin, this
process is tedious and slow.

Luckily there is a way you can test the functionality of the plugin classes
without the need to deploy it to the server (If you need to see how things
render on the server, you still need to deploy it there though). The
_standalone plugin container_ allows you to just load the plugin you want to
test (plus its dependencies, which include the platform plugin) and then issue
commands in an interactive shell.

If you for example want to test the Tomcat plugin, which depends on the
jmx-plugin to make connections to the target servers, you would put the
tomcat-, the jmx- and the platform-plugin into the agents `plugins/`
directory before starting the standalone container.

TIP: removing not-needed plugins from the `plugins/` directory
improves the time for startup and also discovery later.

=== Sample run

To start the standalone PC, you change into the agent directory, copy your
plugin into the `plugins` subdirectory and then call

    $ bin/standalone-pc.sh

in the agent directory
footnote:[Before RHQ 4.5, this command was not installed by default in the
agent's bin directory, but only in the sources under `etc/standalone-pc/`
directory or on sourceforge at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rhq/files/rhq/standalone-container/ .], which
will print a few messages about loading plugins and then wait at a command
prompt. If your plugin does not show up in the printed list, it has probably
some errors in the plugin descriptor. You
can find out by looking at the agent log in `logs/agent.log`.

----
    hrupp$ bin/standalone-pc.sh

    Starting the plugin container.
    Loading plugins
    ...Loaded plugin: HttpCheck
    ...Loaded plugin: Platforms

    Ready.
    [0]:0 >
----

The command prompt now waits for your input. The number in the square brackets
is the number of the current command. The number after the colon a resource id;
we will see that in more detail later. To see a list of commands, you can type
`help`, which shows a list of commands, their abbreviation, possible arguments
and a short description.

One of the first things you want to do here is to discover resources

----
    [0]:0 > disc all
    Discovery took: 5408ms
    [Resource[id=-25, uuid=b1f......
----

To select a resource and to issues specific commands to it, you can set it's id:

----
    [1]:0 > set id -2
    [2]:-2 res
    Resource[id=-2, uuid=2eb2ef5b-9ad4-444b-a1a4-4cced69ff34f,
      type={Platforms}Mac OS X, key=snert, name=snert, parent=<null>,
      version=MacOSX 10.7.4]
    [3]:-2 > m -list
    Native.MemoryInfo.used : MEASUREMENT, The total used system memory
      (does not include buffer or cache memory)
    Native.MemoryInfo.actualUsed : MEASUREMENT, The actual total used system
      memory (includes buffer and cache memory)
    CpuPerc.sys : MEASUREMENT, Percentage of all CPUs running in system mode
    CpuPerc.user : MEASUREMENT, Percentage of all CPUs running in user mode
    [4]:-2 > m m CpuPerc.user MeasurementDataNumeric[name=CpuPerc.user,
       value=0.1188118811881188, scheduleId=1, timestamp=1342878190137]
----

In step 1, we selected resource id -2, then issued the `res` command to see
specifics of the resource. In step 3,
we inquired the list of metrics and in step 4 queried the value of the metric
with the name `CpuPer.user`. The first 'm' in the command is the command name
monitor, the second means that this is a metric.


TIP: To learn about the commands available type `help` at the command prompt.

=== Getting and setting the plugin configuration

Above we have seen how to set the URL for the target to monitor. You can also
inspect and set those
values from the standalone container by running the __pc__ and __pcs__ commands:

    [5]:-2 > pc
    PropertyList[id=0, name=logs, list=[]]
    [6]:-2 > pcs logs=bla
    [7]:-2 > pc
    PropertySimple[id=0, name=logs, value=bla, override=null]

The __pcs__ command does by default set a full configuration, where individual
key-value pairs are separated by `||`. Running `pcs` like this a second time
overwrites the previously set values.

    [7]:-2 > pcs key1=value1||key2=value2

It is also possible to pass individual key-value pairs and merge them with the
values set previously:

    [7]:-2 > pcs key1=value1
    [8|:-2 > pcs -m key2=value2


NOTE: There are analogous commands `rc` and `rcs` that can be used to get and set
teh resource configuration.

=== Command history

When using the standalone-pc, you often want to repeat a command given. For this
purpose a csh-like
command syntax exists. Issuing `!h` gives you an overview of existing commands.

To dispay the history you give `!?`:

    [8]:-2 > !?
    [9]: res
    [10]: set id -2
    [11]: m -list
    [12]: m m CpuPerc.user

To re-run command 2 you say `!2`; to just re-run the last command, you can
simply type `!!`.

=== Finding resources by criteria

When you have a larger plugin you will see that the list of resources
discovered can be quite large and that finding a certain resource
invloves a lot of scrolling. To make this process easier and also to
cater for some automation (see next section), it is possible to run the
`find` command:

[source]
----
[13]: > find r snert  <1>
-2: snert (parent= null )
[14]:0 > set r $r   <2>
[15]:-2 > print
 Resource[id=-2, uuid=2eb2ef5b-9ad4-444b-a1a4-4cced69ff34f,
      type={Platforms}Mac OS X, key=snert, name=snert, parent=<null>,
      version=MacOSX 10.7.4]
----
<1> We are searching for a resource with name 'snert'
<2> The variable `$r` now contains the resource id of the resource found
and can be used to set the resource to work with.

=== Recording and replaying of commands

As you have seen, the system keeps a list of commands issued. You can write
that list of commands
to a file via `!w <filename>`. When you then start the container with that
filename as argument, it will
re-run the commands from the file.

    bin/standalone-pc.sh <filename>

When the standalone container has run all the commands, it will just shut down.

In many times when developing
a new plugin, you want to continue issuing commands and for example check the
executed plugin code in the
debugger. To achieve this, add a `stdin` command before writing the file (or
edit the generated file afterwards).

To make the script resilient to changes in discovery order you can
use the `find` command we have just discussed, so that you do not
have to hardcode resource ids.

== Plugin verification

During development process you will often change items in the plugin descriptor
and your java classes and
if you make a mistake, you will only find out when you deploy the plugin to the
server (or the standalone
container). Actually there is a way to run a basic verification of the plugin.
This checks some basic properties like the syntactical
correctness of the plugin descriptor and if the classes that are denoted as
discovery and component
classes can be found and loaded by the plugin classloaders.

=== Standalone usage

To run the verification you can change into the agent directory and run
`bin/plugin-validator.sh`
footnote:[This standalone way is available from RHQ 4.5 on. Before 4.5 only the
batch check when building all the plugins is available.]
with the plugin-jar as argument like this:

    $bin/plugin-validator.sh $DEV/modules/plugins/httpcheck/target/httpcheck-plugin.jar
    !OK!

If you made an error, the result will be `!FAILED`. In addition error and
warning messages are printed on the
console. More comprehensive logging will written to the agent log
file at `log/agent.log`.

If you have written a plugin that depends on other plugins, you need to provide
them all on the command line.


=== As Part of the build

If you have checked out the whole RHQ source tree, you can add your plugin to
the list of plugins to be verified
when a build of the plugins happens. This verification step checks some basic
properties like the syntactical
correctness of the plugin descriptor and if the classes that are denoted as
discovery and component
classes can be found and loaded by the plugin classloaders.

To do this, you need to add your plugin to the list in
`modules/plugins/validate-all-plugins/pom.xml`:

    <plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>integration-test</phase>
          <configuration>
            <target>
              <property name="test.classpath" refid="maven.test.classpath" />
              <echo>Validating plugins...</echo>
              <java classname="org.rhq.core.pc.plugin.PluginValidator"
                  failonerror="true" fork="true">
                <classpath>
                  <pathelement path="${test.classpath}" />
                  <pathelement
                    location="../apache/target/rhq-apache-plugin-${project.version}.jar" />
                  <!-- as in the next line  vvvvv  -->
                  <pathelement
                    location="../httpcheck/target/httpcheck-plugin-${project.version}.jar" />
                  <!-- ^^^^^^ -->

You just add the path to your plugin to the list of `<pathelement>` elements as
shown above.

== Agent Plugin Plugin

https://github.com/tsegismont[Thomas Segismont] has created a maven plugin,
called the https://github.com/rhq-project/rhq-agent-plugin-plugin["RHQ Agent Plugin Plugin"],
which can be used to run the deployment magic on your local or remote server, run the validator
and much more.

The following shows an excerpt from a `pom.xml` file that can be used to deploy the
plugin to the co called "dev-container":

[source,xml]
----
      <plugins>

        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.rhq.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>rhq-agent-plugin-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>${rhq-agent-plugin-plugin.version}</version>
          <extensions>true</extensions>
          <configuration>
            <deployDirectory>/im/run-rhq/dev-container/rhq-server/plugins/</deployDirectory>
          </configuration>

          <executions>
            <execution>
              <id>deploy-to-dev-container</id>
              <goals>
                <goal>deploy</goal>
              </goals>
              <phase>package</phase>
            </execution>

Actually you can do a lot more - have a look at the documentation for more examples.
At the plugin is still in its early days, contributions are very welcome
