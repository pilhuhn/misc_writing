== Preface
This document builds on a series of blog postings I made on my blog at
<http://pilhuhn.blogspot.com/search/label/RHQ>.
This blog also features other JBoss ON, RHQ and plugin related content that is
not contained here. While this document
also applies to JBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON), I usually will just talk
about RHQ.

Please contact me or my colleagues if you have questions or suggestions.

CAUTION: This document is a best effort attempt into describing the process of
writing agent plugins for RHQ. 
This document may contain errors or omissions. The author assumes no liability.

== Introduction

RHQ Project is the foundation of a powerful open source system management suite.
It builds the framework for other management applications like JBoss ON.
While there is a core set of functionality, the capabilities to manage individual
kinds of target resources is not hard coded into RHQ, but can (or must) be provided
by _plugins_.

This paper will try to show how to write your own plugins for RHQ. This could be
"bare metal" plugins to e.g. determine free disk space or process
availability. It could also be a plugin that determines the number and volume of
orders flowing through your web shop.

As an example scenario the plugin will try to reach a http server, see if the
base URL is available and return the status code + the time it took to reach it.
We will first write a simple version and enhance it afterwards. At the end
I'll be talking about some additional topics around plugin development. But
before we come to this, lets have a look at the environment.

== General architecture of RHQ

Before we go into detailed plugin writing, I first want to show the general
architecture of RHQ and its plugin system.

RHQ follows a hub and spoke approach: A central server (or cluster of servers)
processes data coming in from agents. The data is stored in a database connected
to the server(s). Users and administrators can look at the data and trigger
operations
on the server. This can happen through a web-based GUI, a command line interface
or via the REST-api.

Agents do not have a fixed (read as in compile-time) functionality, but can be
extended through plugins footnote:[In this document when we talk about plugins,
we always mean _agent plugins-] which we will see below. Usually there is one
agent running per machine that has resources to manage.

=== Server side services

The server hosts a number of services like:

* It has a view on the complete Inventory
* It processes incoming measurement data
* It triggers alerts to be sent
* It triggers operations on managed resources
* It hosts the graphical user interface
* It hosts the user management
* ...

Some of those services are reflected in the agent like inventory syncing,
gathering of measurement data or running operations on a managed resource, while
alert processing or hosting of the GUI is purely on the server. 

Note, that a RHQ server never directly talks to a managed resource. Only agents
(or better: their plugins) talk to managed resources.

=== Agent architecture

The agent is sort of a container that hosts some common functionality like the
communication interface with the server, logging, starting and stopping of
plugins, reading configuration files or spooling data in case the server is not
reachable. It is also handling of the command line and interactive command
prompt. 

In addition to this, it hosts the plugin container, who hosts the actual
plugins. When you write a plugin, you talk to the plugin container.

The agent also hosts its it is local view of the inventory (see next section)
for the resources it knows.

=== Central functionality: Inventory

The central piece of functionality in RHQ is the inventory. Each resource that
you want to manage or monitor must be present in that inventory. RHQ has
mechanisms to auto detect and also manually add resources. We'll come back to
that later when we are talking about implementing plugins.
Each `org.rhq.core.domain.resource.Resource` has a certain
`org.rhq.core.domain.resource.ResourceCategory`:

* Platform: This is basically a host where things run on
* Server: Things like database server, JbossAS instance or the RHQ agent
* Service: (Fine grained) Services offered by a server

The ResourceCategory is sort of hierarchic as you can see on the next image:

image::resource_category.png[ResourceCategory]

A platform hosts servers, a server can host other servers and services and a
service can host other services. In theory it is also possible that a platform
is hosting other platforms.
As an example: you have a Red Hat Linux platform, which hosts the RHQ Agent and
JBossAS as a server. This AS it self is hosting a Tomcat server. Both JBossAS
and Tomcat are hosting services like JMS or Connectors.
So at the end this will result in a tree of resources with the Linux platform as
its root.
In addition to the category each Resource also is of a certain
`org.rhq.core.domain.resource.ResourceType`. For a platform this might e.g.
"Max OS X", "Red Hat Linux", "Debian Linux" etc. Or the JBossAS and
Tomcat from above are both of category Server, but have different ResourceType.

== More information on Plugins 

The RHQ wiki now hosts a plugin community page that shows available plugins: RHQ

Check it out for any updates about plugin related information - including
lists of new plugins.

== About RHQ

Red Hat and Hyperic released Project RHQ in the open in February 2008 and we
released the first GA version of RHQ together with JBossON 2.0 that is built on
top of RHQ at JavaOne 2008.

RHQ developers can be reached in *#rhq* on irc://irc.freenode.net, development
forums are hosted on https://community.jboss.org/en/rhq/ and the homepage is
http://jboss.org/rhq/.
