= How To write an agent plugin

This directory contains a paper that describes how to 
write an agent plugin for http://jboss.org/rhq[RHQ].

You can find the start in the file `how_to.adoc`,
which includes the other files.

Unfortunately the preview on GitHub does not allow
to use the `include::` directive, so the how to is
not fully rendered.

To view the full paper or to print it, clone the 
repo and run

`asciidoctor how_to.adoc`

Asciidoctor, an Asciidoc processor written in Ruby is
available from https://github.com/ascidoctor/asciidoctor .
You can also install it as a Ruby gem
